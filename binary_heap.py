Binary Heap Implementation in Python

A heap (binary) is a data structure that can be seen as a complete binary tree.
It is a special case of the more general data structure called a priority queue.
A heap is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property:
- In a max heap, for any given node I, the value of I is greater than or equal to the values of its children.
- In a min heap, the value of I is less than or equal to the values of its children.

For a vector A to be a max heap, it must satisfy the following property:
A[Parent(i)] >= A[i] for all i > 1.

- The height of a node of the tree is the number of edges in the longest path of the node downto a leaf of the tree.
- The tree height is the height of the root node.
- Since a heap induces a binary tree, its height is Î˜(log n).

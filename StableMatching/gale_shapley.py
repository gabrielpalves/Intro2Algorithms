    Gale-Shapley Algorithm

    Suggested implementation from "Algorithm Design - Jon Kleinberg & Ã‰va Tardos":

    1. Identify a free man.
        - Free man will be kept in a linked list:
            - Delete m if he gets engaged
            - If some other man m' becomes free, insert at the front of the list
    2. A man should be able to identify the highest ranking woman he has not yet proposed.
        - Array Next that indicates for each man m the position of the next woman he will propose on his list.
        Next[m] <- Next[m] + 1; after proposal.
    3. For a woman w, we need to decide if w is currently engaged, and if so, identify her partner.
        - Array Current to identify the man m' that w is engaged.
        Current[w] <- Null when she is not engaged.
    4. For a woman w and two men m and m', we need to be able to decide, at runtime, which of the men is preferred by w.
        - Array Ranking n x n containing the rank of man m in the sorted order of w's preferences.
        To decide which of m or m' is preferred by w, Ranking[w, m] and Ranking[w, m'] are compared.
